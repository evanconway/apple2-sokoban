To represent cell state we will use a number represented in binary. Each bit represents what is or isn't located at that cell:

BIT		VALUE
0		PLAYER
1		WALL
2		BOX
3		GOAL

With this we can represent the exact state of a cell as an integer:

BINARY	DECIMAL		VALUE
0000	0			FLOOR (NOTHING THERE)
0001	1			PLAYER
0010	2			WALL
0100	4			BOX
1000	8			GOAL
1001	9			PLAYER AND GOAL
1100	12			BOX AND GOAL

In this sokoban game a cell can only be on of these 7 states.
